     * Workaround for ARDK-2362.
     * Why this is necessary:
     *
     * According to Unity,
     * The reason for simulation failing when switching scenes is due to XR not being "properly de-initialized"
     * when switching scenes. They pointed to the ARF samples, where XR is re-initialized on scene change
     * (https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/arfoundation-samples/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/Runtime/SceneUtility.cs).
     *
     * When asked if this is a necessary step all the time, they said it is "only required when using Simulation".
     * The solution, then is to add this logic to every project, wrapped in #if UNITY_EDITOR.
     * However, since we provide both playback and simulation in-editor, it would be ideal in simulation only.
     * Rather than passing the work of detecting simulation to the users, just force re-init on scene load.
